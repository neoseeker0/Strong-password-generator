# Strong-password-generator
This is a Python program that generates a string of random letters, numbers, and symbols.

When you run the program, it opens up a window called "Strong password generator". 

When the window is open, you can customize the password length. 
  It can't shorter than 4 digits. If you try this, it will show an error.

Next, you can choose which kinds of symbols you want in your password. By default, it is lowercase letters.

Click generate password and the GUI will fill the box below the button with the output.
  
You can then click copy to clipboard to extract the password from the GUI.

I hope that you find this program useful. I made it because I got tired of finding a website that would do this for me.
